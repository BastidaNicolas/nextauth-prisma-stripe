# How To Integrate Subscriptions Into Your Next.js Project (/app). (Next.js, Next-Auth, Prisma, Stripe)
![nextauth-prisma-stripe vercel app_subscription](https://github.com/BastidaNicolas/nextauth-prisma-stripe/assets/74965310/8d54f9ac-0121-416c-a83e-63f3ec6d794a)
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
1. Run the following command to create a new Next.js app:
    ```
    npx create-next-app@latest
    ```

2. Setup Prisma ([documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-mysql)):
    - Install Prisma as a dev dependency:
        ```
        npm install prisma --save-dev
        ```
    - Initialize Prisma:
        ```
        npx prisma init
        ```
    - Set up and connect to your database.
    - Create your database schema in `schema.prisma`.
    - Push the changes to the database:
        ```
        npx prisma db push
        ```
    - Install the Prisma Client library:
        ```
        npm install @prisma/client
        ```
    - Generate the Prisma Client:
        ```
        npx prisma generate
        ```
    - Initiate a global PrismaClient instance in the `lib/prisma.ts` file. In this case, I placed it within the same Prisma folder, `prisma/prisma.ts`. ([documentation](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres#step-4.-install-and-generate-prisma-client))

3. Setup NextAuth ([documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example)):
    - Install dependencies:
        - `npm install next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter`
    - Create `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` API route:
        - [NextAuth.js Route Handlers](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#route-handlers-app):
            - Declare the options that go into `NextAuth()` before `handler` in a variable that is exported, so we can use it later. It should look like this:
                ```typescript
                export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {} // here go all the options.
                ```
        - Import `prisma` from `prisma.ts` and add the `PrismaAdapter` ([Prisma Adapter](https://authjs.dev/reference/adapter/prisma))
        - Import and add providers (in this case, it's `GoogleProvider`) ([Google Provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google)):
            - You'll need to create an OAuth Client ID to get the Client ID and secret ([Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)):
                - Application type: set to "Web Application"
                - Authorized JavaScript origins: add `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT` & `http://localhost` (for deployed app, add the appropriate URL)
                - Authorized redirect URIs: add `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api/auth/callback/google` (for deployed app, add the URL with the same route: `/api/auth/callback/google`)
    - Wrap `main` in a Provider component that contains `SessionProvider` (this component must be tagged with 'use client').
    - Create a signin button component using `useSession`, `signIn`, `signOut` from "next-auth/react" (this component must be tagged with 'use client').
    - This setup should allow you to sign in and sign out successfully. The user should be saved in the database, and a session will be created when logged in.


4. Setup Stripe
    - Create a Stripe account
        - Copy "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" and "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
        - Check the `.env.example` to see how your `.env` should end up
    - Install Stripe and stripe-js
        - Run `npm install stripe --save`
        - Run `npm install @stripe/stripe-js`
    - Modify `schema.prisma`
        - Add the following fields to the `User` model:
            ```prisma
            stripeCustomerId String?   @unique
            isActive         Boolean   @default(false)
            ```
        - Run `npx prisma db push`
        - Run `npx prisma generate`
    - Go to `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
        - After `providers`, add `secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,`
        - Inside `callbacks:{}`, set up a callback function to add necessary values to the session object. This ensures that when a session is checked (`useSession`, `getSession`, `getServerSession`), the required values are available. The callback should look like this:
            ```typescript
            callbacks: {
                async session({ session, user }) {
                    session!.user!.id = user.id;
                    session!.user!.stripeCustomerId = user.stripeCustomerId;
                    session!.user!.isActive = user.isActive;
                    return session;
                },
            },
            ```
        - If you are using TypeScript, create a `types.d.ts` file at the same level as the `src/` folder with the following content:
            ```typescript
            import { DefaultUser } from 'next-auth';

            declare module 'next-auth' {
                interface Session {
                    user?: DefaultUser & { id: string; stripeCustomerId: string; isActive: boolean };
                }
                interface User extends DefaultUser {
                    stripeCustomerId: string;
                    isActive: boolean;
                }
            }
            ```
        - Add `events:{}` to automatically create an account in the Stripe dashboard when a user logs in for the first time. Later, the `stripeCustomerId` will be added to that user's account in our database. It should look like this:
            ```typescript
            events: {
                createUser: async ({ user }) => {
                    const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
                        apiVersion: "2022-11-15",
                    });

                    await stripe.customers.create({
                        email: user.email!,
                        name: user.name!,
                    })
                    .then(async (customer) => {
                        return prisma.user.update({
                            where: { id: user.id },
                            data: {
                                stripeCustomerId: customer.id,
                            },
                        });
                    });
                },
            },
            ```
    - If you have data in your database, delete it (you can use `npx prisma studio` to view and modify your database).
    - At this point, you should be able to log in and see how a user is created in your database with the added values. In your Stripe dashboard, you should also see that a new customer was created.
    - Now we will work on the checkout:
        - Create `/api/stripe/checkout-session/route.ts` API route:
            - Create a `POST` function and import `NextRequest` and `NextResponse`. Declare a `body` variable and initialize Stripe and `getServerSession`. It should look like this:
                ```typescript
                import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
                import { authOptions } from "../../auth/[...nextauth]/route";
                import { getServerSession } from "next-auth";
                import Stripe from "stripe";
    
                export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
                    const body = await req.json();
    
                    const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
                        apiVersion: "2022-11-15",
                    });
    
                    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
                }
                ```
            - Before creating a checkout session, let's validate that the session exists. Otherwise, throw an error:
                ```typescript
                if (!session?.user) {
                    return NextResponse.json(
                        {
                            error: {
                                code: "no-access",
                                message: "You are not signed in.",
                            },
                        },
                        { status: 401 }
                    );
                }
                ```
            - Create the Stripe checkout session ([How Checkout Works](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works)):
                ```typescript
                const checkoutSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
                    mode: "subscription",
                    customer: session.user.stripeCustomerId,
                    line_items: [
                        {
                            price: body,
                            quantity: 1,
                        },
                    ],
                    success_url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL + `/success`,
                    cancel_url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL + `/error`,
                    subscription_data: {
                        metadata: {
                            payingUserId: session.user.id,
                        },
                    },
                });
                ```
            - Ensure that the checkout session returns a URL; otherwise, throw an error:
                ```typescript
                if (!checkoutSession.url) {
                    return NextResponse.json(
                        {
                            error: {
                                code: "stripe-error",
                                message: "Could not create checkout session",
                            },
                        },
                        { status: 500 }
                    );
                }
                ```
            - If everything goes well, return the checkout session:
                ```typescript
                return NextResponse.json({ session: checkoutSession }, { status: 200 });
                ```
            - Let's go to the front-end and add a checkout button on whatever page you want:
                ```jsx
                <button
                    className='bg-slate-100 hover:bg-slate-200 text-black px-6 py-2 rounded-md capitalize font-bold mt-1'
                    onClick={() => handleCreateCheckoutSession(plan)}
                >
                    Go To Checkout
                </button>
                ```
                - Create the `handleCreateCheckoutSession(productId)` async function that receives `productId`. I'll just declare a variable `plan` that contains a product ID.
                    - Create a product in your Stripe dashboard and copy its ID, then save it in a variable.
                    - Inside the function, perform a fetch to your checkout endpoint and add the product ID to the body:
                        ```javascript
                        const res = await fetch(`/api/stripe/checkout-session`, {
                            method: "POST",
                            body: JSON.stringify(productId),
                            headers: {
                                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                            },
                        });
                        ```
                    - The response from the POST request, which should be a checkout session, needs to be parsed and assigned to a variable. Here's an example:
                        ```javascript
                        const checkoutSession = await res.json().then((value) => {
                            return value.session;
                        });
                        ```
                    - Now create a `/app/utils/getStripe.ts` file. Here, we'll declare a reusable `stripePromise`. If `stripePromise` already exists, we won't create a new one but use the already created instance ([read more](https://vercel.com/guides/getting-started-with-nextjs-typescript-stripe#loading-stripe.js)) . The code should look like this:
                        ```javascript
                        import { Stripe, loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';
            
                        let stripePromise: Promise<Stripe | null>;
                        const getStripe = () => {
                            if (!stripePromise) {
                                stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);
                            }
                            return stripePromise;
                        };
            
                        export default getStripe;
                        ```
                    - Going back to `handleCreateCheckoutSession()`, we'll continue by declaring a `stripe` variable and await `getStripe()`. Then, we'll use it for the redirect. Here's an example:
                        ```javascript
                        const stripe = await getStripe();
                        const { error } = await stripe!.redirectToCheckout({
                            sessionId: checkoutSession.id,
                        });
                        // If `redirectToCheckout` fails due to a browser or network
                        // error, display the localized error message to your customer
                        // using `error.message`.
                        console.warn(error.message);
                        ```
                    - That should be all for the checkout to work. Now you should be able to log in, log out, and start a checkout. The next step is to handle Stripe webhooks to modify the `isActive` value of the `User` in the database if the user has paid or the subscription has been canceled.
    - Let's start with the Stripe webhook.
      - Create `/api/webhooks/route.ts`.
        - Initialize Stripe, the `webhookSecret` variable, and the `webhookHandler` async arrow function, and export it as POST. It should look like this:
            ```typescript
            import Stripe from "stripe";
            import prisma from "../../../../prisma/prisma";
            import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
            
            const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
              apiVersion: "2022-11-15",
            });
            
            const webhookSecret: string = process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!;
            
            const webhookHandler = async (req: NextRequest) => {
                // We are going to add things here
            };
            
            export { webhookHandler as POST };
            ```
        - Inside a `try{}catch{}` block, initialize variables to save the request in text form, the "stripe-signature" header, and a `let` variable that is initially undefined. This last variable is used to save the Stripe webhook event that will be created. The code should look like this:

            ```typescript
            try {
                const buf = await req.text();
                const sig = req.headers.get("stripe-signature")!;

                let event: Stripe.Event;
                
                // Rest of the code goes here                        

                // Return a response to acknowledge receipt of the event.
                return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
            } catch {
                // If an error occurs
                return NextResponse.json(
                    {
                        error: {
                            message: `Method Not Allowed`,
                        },
                    },
                    { status: 405 }
                ).headers.set("Allow", "POST");
            }
            ```
        - Inside a `try{}catch{}` block, we will attempt to build the event ([read more](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/handle-verification-outcomes)). If an error occurs, we catch it and handle it accordingly. The code should look like this:

            ```typescript
            try {
                event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(buf, sig, webhookSecret);
            } catch (err) {
                const errorMessage = err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Unknown error";
                // On error, log and return the error message.
                if (!(err instanceof Error)) console.log(err);
                console.log(`❌ Error message: ${errorMessage}`);

                return NextResponse.json(
                    {
                    error: {
                        message: `Webhook Error: ${errorMessage}`,
                    },
                    },
                    { status: 400 }
                );
            }
            ```
        - After that, we add a `switch` statement to handle the event types sent by the Stripe webhook to this endpoint. We will handle "customer.subscription.created" and "customer.subscription.deleted" event types. In each case, we will look for the user in our database that has the same stripeCustomerId as the event and update the user's isActive value. The code should look like this:

            ```typescript
            // Getting the data we want from the event
            const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription;

            switch (event.type) {
                case "customer.subscription.created":
                        await prisma.user.update({
                        // Find the customer in our database with the Stripe customer ID linked to this purchase
                        where: {
                            stripeCustomerId: subscription.customer as string,
                        },
                        // Update that customer so their status is now active
                        data: {
                            isActive: true,
                        },
                        });
                    break;
                case "customer.subscription.deleted":
                        await prisma.user.update({
                        // Find the customer in our database with the Stripe customer ID linked to this purchase
                        where: {
                            stripeCustomerId: subscription.customer as string,
                        },
                        // Update that customer so their status is now active
                        data: {
                            isActive: false,
                        },
                        });
                    break;
                default:
                        console.warn(`🤷‍♀️ Unhandled event type: ${event.type}`);
                    break;
            }
            ```
        - To test this API endpoint locally, you'll have to install the Stripe CLI on your machine. [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

            - After following the steps to log in to the CLI, follow [this guide](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/test#listen-for-events). In this case, the URL would be `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks`. Copy the webhook secret key that it gives you and add it to your `.env` file.

    - Now you should be able to go through the login/logout, checkout, and, if successful, change the `isActive` value to true and if the subscription gets canceled, change it to false.

5. Deploying it

    - Checkout the `.env.example` file in this repository. It should show you all the necessary environment variables needed for this project. If you are deploying to Vercel, you won't need "NEXTAUTH_URL". You can quickly generate the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal.

    - Connect to your GitHub repo and deploying the project.

    - Now, for the webhook to work, you need to go to your [Stripe Developer Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) and add an endpoint. The URL will be `https://YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL/api/webhooks`, and it should listen for `customer.subscription.created` and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.
        - Once created, copy the "Signing secret" and assign it to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

    - Make sure you have added the deployment URL to your Google OAuth Client.

    - After all that, everything should work! 💯 🔥 🎆 🎉 🥳.

### PROBLEMS
- In the last stage, I encountered a problem with the webhook. The Stripe webhooks dashboard displayed the following error:
    ```
    Webhook Error: Error: No signatures found matching the expected signature for the payload. Are you passing the raw request body you received from Stripe? 
    Learn more about webhook signing and explore webhook integration examples for various frameworks at https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node#webhook-signing
    ```

    - I wasn't sure what the problem was with the payload because everything looked fine, it worked in the CLI but not with the Stripe Dashboard Webhook (probably a typo in the code or secret keys), but after rewriting the webhook code, it started working. So, yeah 😑. All night trying to fix that 😂.

### NOTE
The project in this repository closely follows the tutorial in terms of the concepts explained, but it includes some modifications to its user interface. The project has been structured to include login, subscription, and dashboard pages. Additionally, the useSession hook is utilized to verify if the user has permission to access a specific page.

Feel free to give the project a ⭐️ emoji and contact me through any of the social media platforms shown in [my profile](https://github.com/BastidaNicolas).


## Run The Project Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
